## Project Description
In this project I take on the role of a growth analyst at the ecommerce company, MercadoLibre. Using time series analysis techniques I provide management a series of analysis as follows:  
+ Look for unusual trends in hourly google search traffic.
+ Mine the search traffic data for seasonality trends.
+ Compare the search traffic trends to stock price patterns.
+ Use Fbprophet to create a Time Series Model & forecast the next 90 days of google traffic to judge MercadoLibre popularity.
+ Use Fbprophet to create a revenue forecast for Q3 2020
